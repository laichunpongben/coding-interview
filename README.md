## Substitution Cipher Solver

### Time allowed for the exercise: 
Roughly 15 to 20 minutes, reading time inclusive

### Task
You are required to make a substitution cipher solver which solves the key of a given substitution cipher, assuming you don't know the uncrypted text, in reasonable time.
In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a one-to-one translation of characters a-z for an unencrypted text, where the translation mapping is specified by a key.
For example, if the key is "phqgiumeaylnofdxjkrcvstzwb", it means "a"->"p", "b"->"h", and so on. 
Unencrypted text: defend the east wall of the castle
Encrypted text:   giuifg cei iprc tpnn du cei qprcni

### Repository
Clone the materials needed for the exercise at:
https://github.com/laichunpongben/coding-interview

### Unencrypted Text
In `decrypted.txt`. When you solve the problem, you assume you don't know this. For your reference only. 

### Encrypted Text
In `encrypted.txt`. This is after applying the cipher. 

### Vocabularies
In `vocab.txt`. These are the words which come from the uncrypted text, sorted by alphabetical order and delimited by whitespace.

### Evaluation
In descending significance:
* How you approach and solve the problem. Even psuedo-code or skeleton code can be material. 
* Coding style
* Interaction with the peer (that's the interviewer, if any)
* Level of completion. However, don't feel discouraged if you cannot finish the solver. 

### You are allowed to:
* Use your own PC (or interviewer's PC), and your choice of programming language and development environment. 
* Get help from googling/stackoverflow etc. But please don't directly search for "How to make a substitution cipher" or copy codes from GitHub etc. Remember, the purpose of this exercise is to evaluate YOUR skills.
* Discuss with the interviewer, if any. Think aloud may help.
* Ask the interviewer to shut up/leave, if you find him/her disturbing. 
* Ask for wifi access, if necessary

Good luck and happy coding!
